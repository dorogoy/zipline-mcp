# Brief

This project, the Zipline MCP Server, is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed to facilitate file uploads to Zipline-compatible hosts. Its primary objective is to bridge MCP clients with Zipline's file hosting service, offering features such as secure file uploads, validation, and advanced management options like setting expiration dates, passwords, view limits, and specific folders for uploaded files. Key features include support for various file types, a sandboxed temporary file manager for secure operations, the ability to download external URLs directly into the sandbox, and comprehensive user file management capabilities including listing and searching previously uploaded files. Developed with Node.js and TypeScript, it leverages the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to provide a robust and secure solution for automated file management within the MCP ecosystem.
